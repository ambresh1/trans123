        "I watch my feet moving me forward as I walk into the great hall. My sneakers are worn out, the once black color now faded to a dark gray and the soles hanging on by a thread. It's time to put in a request for new ones. Admittedly, I probably should have done so months ago. It's a surprise that my superiors haven't noticed and made me change into my ill-fitting, uncomfortable pair.\n",
        "\"I wonder what this is all about.\" Vera murmurs as she comes to stand next to me, her voice so quiet that I barely hear it above the murmurs of the humans inside.\n",
        "Sighing, I drag my gaze from my shoes and look around the room. All of the castle's servants are standing around, confused expressions on their faces as they talk amongst themselves. It seems as if nobody has any clue why we've been summoned here. \n",
        "The King's Second commanded that all the castle's servants be in the Great Hall before breakfast for an announcement, but that's all the information he gave. \n",
        "I shrug, responding to Vera. \"Me too. It's not often that they do this.\"\n",
        "My mind flashes back to the last time the Royals had such a formal announcement, and I hold back a grimace. Some wealthy Beasts from a nearby land were coming to visit, and we were warned that their treatment of humans was harsh and to be on our best behavior. \n",
        "Up until that day I never realized just how terrifying the Beasts can be. King Richard has always been relatively kind to us, making sure we are fed and clothed, but the others that came to visit operated in a much different manner. On the first day of their visit, one of the men was eyeing a kitchen girl and as she was serving him his meal, this mate reached across the table and murdered her. \n",
        "The girl's throat was ripped out in one swift motion. She was frozen for a moment, almost as if her brain couldn't comprehend what had happened, before she crumpled onto the floor. There wasn't even a lull in the conversation for the Beasts. They continued on with their meal as if nothing had even happened. It was horrific, and was whispered about for months.\n",
        "As Vera and I continue walking into the room,I glance around trying to spot John. He stands a good foot above the other human men, and with his overgrown mop of pale blonde hair he's generally hard to miss. \n",
        "I quickly spot him talking with a group of men near the front entrance, but before I can make my way over the room falls silent. Everybody turns to face the doorway behind me, and I follow their lead.\n",
        "Spinning around, I watch King Richard and his Second step into the room. Uncomfortable with their close proximity, I shuffle backward slightly. I know that the action won't go unnoticed, but it's important I keep a safe distance in case they are angry with us. \n",
        "My movement causes the King to glance at me before peering around the room. He takes his time, carefully inspecting each and every one of us, occasionally nodding to himself. \n",
        "I can feel my palms getting sweaty, and I resist the urge to wipe them on my dress. Instead opting to clench them into fists by my side. Why is he looking at us like this?\n",
        "The King's gaze suddenly snaps back to the center of the room and he clears his throat, preparing to speak. \n",
        "\"Hello all,\" he starts, both his face and voice void of any emotion. \"I'm sure you are all wondering why you are here. It has been requested that a small number of you transfer to Ziad, the kingdom immediately North of here. We have yet to decide on who will be going, but decisions will be made by the end of the day. Continue working as normal, and we will inform you later today should you be chosen to leave.\"\n",
        "I feel my breath leave my body at his words, my shoulders slumping forward in relief. I'm a strong worker here at the castle, and it is unlikely that I will be chosen to leave. \n",
        "Just as quickly as he arrived, the King turns and leaves the room, his Second following behind. The moment they are out of sight conversations begin to break out amongst the humans.\n",
        "I spin back around to face the room, noticing that Vera has already left my side and is speaking with John. I swiftly make my way over to them, wiping my sweaty palms on my dress in an attempt to wick away the moisture that had accumulated while in the presence of the King.\n",
        "\"Who do you think will be chosen?\" John asks Vera, nervousness apparent in his voice. \"I hope it's not me. I've heard awful things about Ziad.\"\n",
        "John catches my eye as I approach his left and shifts his body to the right, making room for me to join their conversation. His eyebrows furrow together as he thinks over her question, his bottom lip sliding between his teeth to bite at the dry skin. \n",
        "\"He said that only a small number are going, so odds are we should be fine.\" I chime in, trying to soothe his worries. \n",
        "Vera frowns, looking just as stressed as John. She grabs a curl resting on her collarbone, pulling it straight and mindlessly fiddling with the ends. \n",
        "\"What have you heard about them?\" She asks John, ignoring my statement. \n",
        "\"That they are cruel. That humans are treated like trash. That their servants are maimed and punished for the smallest of mistakes.\" John glances at me, \"They would probably whip you for wearing such raggedy shoes around.\"\n",
        "I frown, glancing down at my feet once more. Would I really be punished for such a small thing? I hear John let out a dry laugh, and can't help but to let some worry seep into my bones. I've never left King Richard's kingdom, and don't have a lot of insight into how the other ones treat their humans. \n",
        "It's no secret that we aren't exactly loved by the Beasts, but our King treats us well. We are fed two meals a day, and are even allowed one day off a month. \n",
        "\"I've heard that the Royals in Ziad are even worse than the Beasts that came to visit last summer!\" John continues.\n",
        "Vera and I exchange glances, and she lets out a visible shudder. Her fingers continue to pull at her curls, an action she does whenever she is overcome with anxiety.\n",
        "\"We should get back to work,\" Vera says suddenly, her voice a higher pitch than normal. \"I don't want to think about this anymore.\"\n",
        "I nod in agreement, wishing the two goodbye, before turning and heading towards the kitchen. It's Tuesday, which means that I need to help with breakfast before rushing to the King's quarters to help tidy up with John. \n",
        "The kitchen is alive with chatter by the time I arrive. Everybody is making guesses as to who will be chosen, and spilling all the secrets they have heard about the Ziad kingdom. I try to stay out of it, not wanting to get involved. Besides, I still don't think that I will be chosen to go. \n",
        "My task of cleaning the King's quarters is a pretty important one. It signals that I am a trustworthy servant and, given that I have been doing it for years with no mishaps, proves that I do not pry or speak about any information that I happen to overhear while I am there. Given all the gossip that is being spread today, I would guess that that's a pretty hard trait to come by.\n",
        "Breakfast goes by fairly quickly. I was not asked to help with serving, and instead was made to stay inside the kitchen and plate the food. This morning's meal was pretty simple, consisting of eggs, bacon, sausage, and toast.\n",
        "I was told once that this was a dish commonly eaten by humans before the Beasts came. Apparently they adopted a number of our traditions when they took over, particularly the ones surrounding cuisine. \n",
        "The scent of the foods makes my mouth salivate, bringing my incredibly empty stomach to the forefront of my mind. I wasn't able to eat my second meal yesterday, having been running late on my cleaning, and am paying for it now. Sharp pains strike my sides as my stomach continuously rumbles, but I ignore it knowing that I'll be able to eat after the Beasts have finished their food. \n",
        "Once finished plating all the food, I head over to the sink to wash my hands and grab some cleaning supplies. Needing to distract myself from my hunger, I disinfect all the counters and move all the dishes we used while cooking into the sink.\n",
        "\"You're free to go eat your breakfast now.\" The head chef tells me, waving her arm in the direction of the servant's dining room. \n",
        "I shoot her a quick thanks before rushing out of the room. Cleaning the King's quarters takes up most of the day, meaning I need to eat quickly if I'm going to finish with enough time for dinner. \n",
        "The dining room is already full, the topic of conversation continuing to be about Ziad and the transfers. I find an empty seat between one of the gardeners and laundry women, and plop down into it. \n",
        "\"You know, I wouldn't mind being transferred. The rules may be harsh, but have you seen their King? Talk about gorgeous.\" The laundry woman laughs out before shoving a spoonful of porridge into her mouth. \n",
        "I grab a bowl from the center of the table and serve myself a couple large scoops of porridge. A smile spreads across my face as I notice that they put in some brown sugar today. \n",
        "An elderly woman sitting across from Emma and I scoffs, \"Watch what you're saying.\" she points her spoon at Emma \"You don't want them hearing and putting you on that list. Besides, do you really think that the King would be interested in some human? Wishful thinking.\"\n",
        "\"I heard that a boy was killed once simply for sneezing.\" The Gardner pipes in. \n",
        "Emma laughs, \"Yeah, but to be fair I heard that he actually sneezed on the King.\"\n",
        "The trio continues to bicker back and forth, and at some point I tune them out to focus on shoveling the food into my mouth. I don't have time to waste, and manage to finish eating in just a couple of minutes.\n",
        "John is probably already waiting for me outside the King's quarters. The thought makes me rush through the halls, not wanting to keep him waiting for too long. My hypothesis is proven correct as I round the corner into the large corridor that leads to the King and Second's suites, immediately spotting John standing outside the pair of large oak doors. \n",
        "\"Sorry I'm late,\" I apologize. \"I ate some breakfast before heading over.\"\n",
        "John shoots me a smile, his shoulders rising in a quick shrug. \"No worries! Just got here a minute ago myself.\"\n",
        "As I come up next to him I notice that his signature messy hair has been combed back, and it even looks as if the ends have been tripped. Surprised, I bring my gaze down over his body, seeing that he is wearing his finest shirt and his black shoes appear to have been polished. \n",
        "\"Why are you so uh-,\" I stammer, trying to find the right work. \"Cleaned up?\"\n",
        "John tenses, and I watch as his cheeks turn a light shade of red. He gives me a crooked, embarrassed smile and brings his hand up behind his neck, fingering the short ends of his hair. \n",
        "\"I thought that if I cleaned myself up that I would be less likely to be chosen.\"\n",
        "John's always been a bit of a worrywart, but this is excessive even for him. Holding back a frown, I give him a soft smile that I hope is comforting. \n",
        "\"Well, you look very nice! I'll take the King's suites if you want to work on the Second's? Then we can head down to get dinner after.\" I suggest, attempting to change the subject.\n",
        "John agrees, and we part ways to begin our work. Typically there is a Beast on guard to make note of the time we enter and exit, as well as who goes into which set of suites, but none are present today. I've been in charge of cleaning the suites with John since we were 14, and over the years the guard has gotten more relaxed.\n",
        "I throw my body into the heavy door, pressing my shoulder into it for extra support. It opens just enough for me to fit through, and I slip inside, the door slamming behind me with a loud thud. \n",
        "Glancing around the entryway, I am pleasantly surprised to see that the King has kept both his shoes tidy and the small table along the left wall free of clutter. I continue down the hallway until it opens up into the living room. \n",
        "\"Oh.\" \n",
        "I hum quietly, looking over the mess that has become this room. Empty bottles are strewn about, and multiple photos lay haphazardly on the couch and table. A children's book lays open on the floor, the pages romanticizing the Beasts' invasion some 200 years ago, and there are half-eaten plates sitting on the bookshelves that line the far left wall. \n",
        "Knowing how important the photos are to the King, I decide to start there first to ensure that nothing spills on them as I clean. I'm surprised that he took them out in the first place. King Richard was looking at them daily after the death of his mate, but in the past couple of years has stopped looking at them all together. \n",
        "I make sure to pick them up carefully, flipping the images so they are all facing the same direction, before placing them back in the albums that they were taken from. I learned years ago which photos belong to which albums, but still take my time making sure not to misplace any. \n",
        "With the photos safely tucked away, I make quick work with the rest of the room. It's tedious, but relatively easy work. Before I know it I'm finishing up the dusting and bringing the full trash back to the front door. \n",
        "Thankfully the living room was the only room in poor shape, and I'm able to finish up most of my cleaning within a couple of hours. \n",
        "Approaching the front door, I ball up my hand into a fist and bang against it a couple of times. Usually the Beast on guard is able to open it for me, but since he's gone today I have to rely on John. \n",
        "I spent a good two years convinced that if I tried hard enough I would be able to pry open the heavy front doors, but eventually gave up and accepted that while I can push them open just enough to slip inside, I don't have enough strength to pull them towards me to get out. \n",
        "John doesn't come to open the door, and after a couple more bangs I accept that he is probably still cleaning and I need to sit and wait.\n",
        "Already I can feel my hunger settling in. My stomach has been rumbling for the past two hours, but within the past 30 or so minutes I've begun to feel the sharp pains return. Just the thought of eating some food has me salivating. \n",
        "In a moment of weakness I contemplate digging through the trash and eating some of the leftovers that the King didn't finish, but even as I think it I know that I won't actually go through with it. The punishment would be too great if I was caught. \n",
        "Every few minutes I give a couple pounds on the front door, not knowing when to expect John to leave the Second's quarters. After waiting for what feels like an hour I hear the door groan. Knowing that this is a sign that it's about to open, and quickly step backward and begin gathering the trash bags in my hands. \n",
        "\"Took you long enough!\" I exclaim as it pops open, \"I was starting to get worried that we would miss-,\"\n",
        "The words die in my throat as I look up to see the King standing in front of me, his hand holding the door open with ease. A mocking smirk spreads across his face as he realizes that I've been trapped inside. \n",
        "\"Come on out. I need to speak to both you and that young man you clean with.\" \n",
        "He steps aside, giving me space to squeeze past him into the main corridor. I sign in relief as I realize that I am not going to be punished for speaking to him in such a way. \n",
        "As I exit the quarters I spot John standing against the far wall to my left. He refuses to meet my eye, opting instead to stare at his overly shined shoes. I make my way over to him, dropping the garbage bags to my right and bringing my hands behind my back. I bow my head, showing respect to the King, before looking back up at him. I see John do the same out of the corner of my eye. \n",
        "\"Given the announcement this morning, I am sure that you are aware of what I need to speak to you two about. You have both been chosen to transfer to the Ziad castle. It was a hard decision, and you two were not among my top choices, but King Heloix specifically requested we send our best servants.\" He informs us, a slight frown etched onto his face. \n",
        "I don't move, my mind trying to wrap around what he's just told us. Seconds pass in silence as the King watches us. I clear my throat, the sound reverberating throughout the long corridor. \n",
        "\"When do we leave?\" I finally muster up the courage to ask, wincing as my voice cracks slightly. \n",
        "King Richard purses his lips, eyes darting between John and I. John shuffles his feet, the movement subtle, while I fiddle with my fingers behind my back. It's a futile attempt to comfort myself.\n",
        "\"Tomorrow afternoon.\"\n",

After experiencing everything for four times, I knew I was not the loved pampered heiress I thought I was. I was just a tool. A tool to connect two most powerful families on the continent. \n",
        "Father did not love me. If Rachelle who was more docile, more beautiful and more well-tempered could replace me, then so be it. With Rachelle as a comparison, I was just a disappointment. Someone who was known to have a bad temper, an airhead who only knew to spend money. As time went by, I was just someone who brought disgrace to the family. They would have disowned me if their pride allowed them to. \n",
        "I had been a childish, spoiled heiress through and through in my first life. I had looked down on Rachelle, I thought she was just a silly country girl with no manners. She would never be on the same par as me. She would even make me look superior. I had been childish like that. But I was wrong, I was the one acting as a stepping stone for Rachelle. \n",
        "Rachelle had perfect manners and temperament as opposed to my well known bad temper. Rachelle was a beauty whereas I was just someone with pleasing features. Rachelle had more talents in magic than me. Rachelle shone in every aspects while I shivered in her shadows. \n",
        "This was not what I had expected. I was not supposed to be the one hovering in the shadows. My pride could not take that. I had been brimming with envy. When even my fiance fell for Rachelle and told my father he would like to marry Rachelle instead, that was the final straw. I became the evil villainess in every romance story. \n",
        "Looking back, I knew it was childish and not worth it. What I had been doing was just a pathetic joke to Rachelle. \n",
        "But did I deserve the way I met my death? To be burnt alive on a stake in front of everyone? Do you know how painful it was to be burnt? Do you know how it felt to smell the way your skin and tissues turning to ashes? Do you know the despair of knowing your life being burnt away bit by bit?\n",
        "I had never harmed anyone physically. It was all just angry words and hysterical fits like every pampered spoiled heiress who threw their tempers. The worst I did was trying to cheat in an attempt to win her in a magic duel. I had been quite silly really. That's how I had fallen into the trap of one of Rachelle's suitors and ended my tragic life. And started this never ending hell. \n",
        "When I realized I had been reborn in my second life. I had been brimming with hatred and anger, I had wanted revenge. So much that my second life had ended much more quickly than my first. \n",

            "The reflection might be amazing, but can someone tell her what happened?\n",
            "It was a summer vacation, and she just jumped with her friends, and she closed her eyes before she jumped, but by the time she opened them again, she was in this weird place.\n",
            "Where were her friends?\n",
            "Another thing that really bothered Le Yao Yao is that despite how attractive \"she\" looked, why was she wearing a dark blue eunuch suit?\n",

            "After the shock, Le Yao Yao could accept reality and calm down slowly.\n",
            "She said: \"O my people!\n",
            "Deep down, she knew that she would never see her father, mother, and friends again.\n",
            "After thinking about it, Le Yao Yao became very sad, but before she could grieve, a sharp and clear voice entered her ears and made her jump.\n",
            "It turns out you're here, I'm glad you're easy to find.\n",
            "The man who came up to her was a little eunuch who was probably 15 to 16, he was at Le Yao Yao's age, and he was wearing a dark blue eunuch uniform, and he was very thin, and his skin looked tender, and it surprised Le Yao Yao, because it was a real eunuch, not the one she was watching on TV.\n",
            "Except she was a eunuch now, but she was a fake version!\n",
            "And frankly, she had no idea who that guy was, although she was taken to this body, she had no memory of the previous owner, so she had no idea who was talking to her, so she came up with a final decision in the books, pretending to lose her memory.\n",
            "That's right!\n",
            "Le Yao Yao stuck her nose, lifted her white and white hand, and pressed her against her forehead.\n",
            "Thinking about it, she often participated in many of the stories at school.\n",
            "\"Sss, I have such a headache, Aya, who are you? Why don't I remember who I am?\"\n",
            "I'm Xiao Mu Zi, don't scare me!\n",
            "Seeing Le Yao Yao's painful expression, Xiao Mu Zi was extremely concerned, his eyes showed that he was worried and worried that Le Yao Yao felt a little guilty.\n",
            "After all, this man really cared about her, and she lied to him.\n",
            "But she was only half lying, to be honest, she had no idea whose body she was in, so she had to pretend to lose her memory.\n",
            "She looked around her earlier and noticed that she was in a remote area with a very tall wall next to her, she heard a lot of noise behind the wall, she thought about it, probably the main streets outside the walls, and now she was probably in the backyard of the house.\n",
            "She didn't know why the previous owner was here.\n",
            "According to Le Yao Yao, the previous owner probably tried to turn over the wall.\n",
            "Le Yao Yao had no idea what happened to the previous owner, but she wanted to know whose body it was, and she'd try to stay alive for herself.\n",
            "After all, she traveled through time, and if she doesn't do some investigation, it's gonna be very difficult for her to survive here.\n",
            "While Le Yao Yao thought suddenly Xiao Mu Zi's expression became harsh, he seriously asked, \"Yao Yao Zi, you're trying to trick me, aren't you? You're just pretending to be stupid. In fact, you haven't lost your memory, right?\"\n",
            "\"Uh...\"\n",
            "Heard Xiao Mu Zi say that Le Yao Yao was shocked how that stupid eunuch could be so smart, could her acting skills be too poor, she couldn't even fool him?\n",
            "Xiao Mu Zi then sighed and looked at her with a pathetic expression.\n",
            "\"Xiao Yao Zi, no matter what you're trying to do, you can't avoid that, \"who told you to be so unhappy and drew the written bamboo sticks to serve Prince Rui for a month, you're destined to serve him next month, good luck with the drawing, and maybe you won't be so unhappy next time...\"\n",
            "Xiao Mu Zi then sighed again, and his words caused great curiosity in Le Yao Yao.\n",
            "How did Xiao Mu Zi make the prince a three-star monster?\n",
            "When Le Yao Yao heard the answer, Xiao Mu Zi's mouth expanded and finally believed her words.\n",
            "\"Oh, my God, Xiao Yao Zi, did you really lose your memory?\n",
            "Le Yao Yao hit her head.\n",
            "Seeing this, Xiao Mu Zi had no choice but to explain everything about the present identity of Prince Rui and Le Yao Yao, he told her everything he knew.\n",
            "Turns out the dynasty was called a paradise Yuan dynasty that never existed in history!\n",
            "The new emperor was Leng Jun Tian, who was politically active and loved all men.\n",
            "The current emperor also has a brother named Leng Jun Yu, also known as Prince Rui.\n",
            "Although they weren't from the same mother, they've had a great relationship since they were young.\n",
            "Despite this, the Emperor and Prince Rui were the polar opposites.\n",
            "As for Xiao Mu Zi and her, they came here two months ago, but all they've been doing so far were strange works in the yard, they haven't seen Prince Rui yet, even though they've heard a lot of stories about him.\n",
            "Rumor has it that Prince Rui was incredibly handsome, extremely wise and strategic.\n",
            "But even though he was talented and brilliant, he was ruthless and unpredictable.\n",
            "If he had been provoked, he would have been slapped for light punishment.\n",
            "After all, in the imperial residence, the servant's life was comparable to a lot of grass.\n",
            "Last month, a newly arrived eunuch accidentally knocked down a cup of tea, and Prince Rui killed him on the spot.\n",
            "Sources say that the eunuch's brain went from pavilion to lotus pond, and then the chief manager ordered people to fish day and night before they could find their head.\n",
            "Then ghost stories began to appear.\n",
            "Some said that by passing the lotus, they would hear the voice of a small eunuch calling for his brain to be found.\n",
            "Since then, all the servants who served Prince Rui have been very careful, every time they were in his presence, they have not even dared to breathe louder, and in the end a few eunuchs have become insane.\n",
            "The chief manager panicked, no one dared to serve Prince Rui, he has to do something!\n",
            "At the end of the day, he came up with a great idea. From now on, all eunuchs will have to go through a binding draw. Whoever drew Prince Rui's name will have to serve him for a month. A new tie will appear at the beginning of each month.\n",
            "Unfortunately for Le Yao Yao, the owner of this body drew a bamboo wand named Prince Rui, perhaps that's why she tried to turn over the walls.\n",
            "Of course, Le Yao Yao had no proof, she just assumed she was still listening to Xiao Mu Zi.\n",
            "Suddenly Xiao Mu Zi took a look at the sky and started to worry.\n",
            "Xiao Yao Zee, we can't stay here!\n",
            "\"What, why do I have to do this?\" I don't want to, okay?\n",
            "Although Le Yao Yao was usually loud and fearless, after hearing the stories of Prince Rui, she could not help but place Prince Rui in the category of danger.\n",
            "How can she not be afraid of someone who can take a life when she wants to?\n",
            "After thinking about it, Le Yao Yao became a coward.\n",
            "Xiao Mu Zi understood Le Yao Yao and felt sorry for her, and frankly, he had a good relationship with Xiao Yao Zi. If he could, he would have replaced him. But he was worried about Prince Rui's outbreak. What if he had pissed Prince Ruy off and decapitated him? What would have happened to his family?\n",
            "The reason he was here was because he had to support his five brothers and sisters, and his parents had no choice but to send him to the palace and turn him into a eunuch, so he couldn't and shouldn't die, he had to send money home every month!\n",
            "So Xiao Mu Zi could only pray to heaven and hope Xiao Yao Zi would survive the month he brought the unwanted Le Yao Yao to Prince Rui's residence.\n",

            "\"Oh, my God! It's so beautiful!\" cried Le Yao Yao in surprise. Her shining bright eyes showed curiosity and joy, and her mouth was open, and her excitement was evident.\n",
            "In the past, she always liked to look at ancient architecture, and then she thought about seeing the Forbidden City in Beijing, but it was amazing that she was here before she did.\n",
            "Although she was never in the Forbidden City, this magnificent palace was probably even more luxurious than the real one!\n",
            "Wherever she looked, she was surrounded by a red brick wall, a ladder leading to buildings and balconies was a layer, because of size and design, she gave an extremely scary and powerful aura.\n",
